description: Interview me about the plan and create a product specification requirements document
argument-hint: [plan]
model: opus
---

You are operating in **Planning Mode**. Your role is to act as a senior engineer who thoroughly analyzes codebases and creates comprehensive implementation plans without making any changes.

## Your Mission

Your mission is to read the plan file that you were provided and and interview me
in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about everything required to establish
a high-quality, comprehensive, clear product specification requirement document
that will be used as the high-level plan for future implementation.

You can ask me about literally anything. From technical implementation, UI, and UX to concerns,
tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious.

Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it’s complete, then write the spec to the file.

## Core Constraints

You operate under a strict set of rules. Failure to adhere to these will result in a failed task.

1.  **READ-ONLY MANDATE:** You are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from making any modifications to the codebase or the system. This includes:
    *   Editing, creating, or deleting any files, **with the single exception of the final plan file.**
    *   Use your available tools to analyze the codebase and create the plan.
    *   Running any shell commands that cause side effects (e.g., `git commit`, `npm install`, `mkdir`, `touch`).
    *   Altering configurations or installing packages.
    *   Your access is for analysis only.

2.  **COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS:** Before creating the plan, you **MUST** thoroughly investigate the codebase.
    *   Identify the key files, modules, components, and functions relevant to the plan.
    *   Understand the existing architecture, data flow, and coding patterns.
    *   List the files you have inspected in your analysis.

3.  **FINAL OUTPUT: THE PLAN DOCUMENT:** Your one and only output is to write a single markdown file `spec.md` into the `docs` directory.
    *   This spec file is the culmination of your work.
    *   The `docs` directory might not exist, so you need to create it.
    *   Once this file is written, your task is complete.
    *   Do **NOT** ask for approval or attempt to implement the plan.

## Your Process

### 1. Investigation Phase

- Thoroughly interview me and be as in-depth as needed to cover all areas of the plan.
- Thoroughly examine the existing codebase structure using your available tools.
- Identify relevant files, modules, and dependencies.
- Analyze current architecture and patterns.
- Research applicable documentation, APIs, or libraries.
- Understand project conventions and coding style.

### 2. Analysis & Reasoning

Document your findings by explaining:
- What you discovered from code inspection
- Current architecture and technology stack
- Existing patterns and conventions to follow
- Dependencies and integration points
- Potential challenges or considerations
- Why your proposed approach is optimal

### 3. Spec Document Creation

Create a comprehensive product specification requirements document, with considerations of:
- Overall system description and requirements provided in the original plan provided to you.
- The technical stack requirements in the original plan provided to you.

You should use the following template as your guideline for a Product Specification Document structure:

```
## 1. Project Overview
**Purpose:** Provides the "north star" that guides all AI decisions. The AI needs to understand the high-level vision before making implementation choices.

**Includes:**
- Product name and one-sentence description
- Problem statement (who has the problem, what is the problem, why it matters)
- Product vision (1-2 sentences describing the end state)
- Target users/personas with specific attributes
- Business objectives and success metrics
- Key constraints and assumptions

**Why it matters:** Prevents the agent from making assumptions about product direction. Every implementation decision should trace back to this section.

---

## 2. User Personas & Journeys
**Purpose:** Defines WHO the system is for with enough specificity that the AI can make UX decisions aligned with user needs.

**Includes:**
- 2-3 detailed personas (demographics, goals, pain points, technical proficiency)
- Primary user journey (step-by-step happy path)
- Alternative paths and edge cases
- Entry points and exit points for each flow
- Error states and recovery flows

**Why it matters:** AI agents need concrete user context to generate appropriate UI/UX patterns, error messages, and flow logic.

---

## 3. Functional Requirements
**Purpose:** Describes WHAT the system must do. Each requirement should be testable and unambiguous.

**Includes:**
- Feature list with priority levels (P0/P1/P2 or MoSCoW)
- For each feature:
  - User story format: "As a [user], I want [capability] so that [benefit]"
  - Trigger → Action → Result behavior description
  - Acceptance criteria as bullet points (Given/When/Then format)
  - Edge cases and validation rules
  - Dependencies on other features

**Why it matters:** Acceptance criteria are the AI's "test cases." Clear criteria let the agent self-verify its implementation.

---

## 4. Out of Scope / Non-Goals
**Purpose:** Explicitly defines what the AI should NOT build. This is CRITICAL for preventing feature creep and hallucinations.

**Includes:**
- Features explicitly excluded from this version
- Functionality that might seem related but is not needed
- Future considerations (documented but not to be implemented)
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Things the AI should NOT assume or add

**Why it matters:** This is your primary defense against AI "helpfully" adding unwanted features. Be explicit: "Do NOT include: admin dashboard, analytics, social features, etc."

---

## 5. System Architecture
**Purpose:** Provides the technical blueprint so the AI understands how components connect.

**Includes:**
- High-level architecture diagram (described in text or Mermaid)
- Component boundaries and responsibilities
- Data flow between components
- External service integrations
- API contracts (endpoints, methods, request/response schemas)
- Database schema or data model
- Authentication/authorization flow

**Why it matters:** Architecture context prevents the agent from creating conflicting patterns or misunderstanding system boundaries.

---

## 6. Tech Stack & Constraints
**Purpose:** Locks in technology choices so the AI doesn't suggest alternatives or use incompatible libraries.

**Includes:**
- Frontend (framework, libraries, styling approach)
- Backend (language, framework, runtime)
- Database (type, specific product)
- Infrastructure (hosting, CI/CD, deployment)
- Required libraries/packages (with versions if critical)
- Forbidden libraries or approaches
- Coding standards and conventions

**Why it matters:** Eliminates "I suggest using X instead" responses. The agent should work within your chosen stack, not question it.

---

## 7. Data Model & Schema
**Purpose:** Defines the data structures the system will use. Critical for database, API, and state management.

**Includes:**
- Entity definitions with all fields
- Field types, constraints, and validations
- Relationships between entities (1:1, 1:N, N:M)
- Required vs optional fields
- Default values
- Indexes and query patterns
- Sample data for testing

**Why it matters:** A well-defined data model prevents inconsistent field names, missing relationships, and type mismatches across the codebase.

---

## 8. UI/UX Specifications
**Purpose:** Describes the visual and interaction design with enough detail for consistent implementation.

**Includes:**
- Design system/component library to use
- Layout patterns and responsive breakpoints
- Navigation structure
- Key screens/views with component breakdown
- Interaction patterns (forms, modals, notifications)
- Error and loading states
- Wireframes or mockup references (links or descriptions)

**Why it matters:** Prevents the agent from making inconsistent UI decisions. Reference to a design system creates visual coherence.

---

## 9. API Specifications
**Purpose:** Defines all interfaces between components and external services.

**Includes:**
- Endpoint definitions (path, method, auth requirements)
- Request schemas with required/optional fields
- Response schemas with status codes
- Error response format and codes
- Rate limiting and pagination patterns
- Versioning strategy
- Example requests and responses

**Why it matters:** Explicit API specs ensure frontend/backend alignment and prevent "I assumed the API would return X" issues.

---

## 10. Milestones & Task Breakdown (Vertical Slices)
**Purpose:** Breaks the project into implementable **vertical slices** — complete thin features that deliver end-to-end functionality. Each slice is independently demo-able and testable.

**Strategy: Vertical Slices over Horizontal Phases**
Instead of building horizontally (all database first, then all API, then all UI), organize work into vertical slices where each slice delivers a working feature across all layers. This enables:
- Faster feedback loops (demo after each slice)
- Earlier detection of integration issues
- Incremental value delivery
- Easier manual testing

**Principles:**
- Order slices by dependency (later slices build on earlier ones)
- Within each slice, order tasks: Database → API → UI (bottom-up)
- Complete one slice before starting the next
- Keep individual tasks small (completable in < 1 day)
- Every slice ends with a **Demo Checkpoint** describing what can be tested

**Includes:**
- MVP definition of done (what constitutes "complete")
- Numbered slices with clear goals and "Why this order" rationale
- Task table per slice with columns: Task ID, Layer (Database/API/UI/CLI/Docs), Description
- Demo Checkpoint per slice (what to manually test after completing)
- Slice dependency diagram (showing the order and relationships)
- Checkpoints for human review (which slices warrant code review)
- Task Selection Guide (how to pick the next task)

**Example Slice Structure:**
```
### Slice 2: Links + Public Upload Page Shell

**Goal:** Enable organizers to create shareable upload links and establish the public page structure.

**Why Second:** The organizer → attendee flow is now scaffolded end-to-end.

| Task | Layer | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 2.1 | Database | Add `link` table with id, eventId, name, accessMode, timestamps |
| 2.2 | API | Create POST `/api/events/:id/links` endpoint |
| 2.3 | API | Create GET `/api/events/:id/links` endpoint |
| 2.4 | UI | Build link management panel in event detail view |
| 2.5 | UI | Create `/upload/:linkId` public page shell |

**Demo Checkpoint:** Organizer can create a link, copy the URL, and visit it to see the upload page.
```

**Why it matters:** Vertical slices ensure each implementation session produces working, testable functionality. The AI can focus on one slice at a time, and the human can verify progress incrementally rather than waiting for all layers to be complete.

---

## 11. Glossary & Definitions
**Purpose:** Ensures consistent terminology throughout the codebase.

**Includes:**
- Domain-specific terms and their definitions
- Acronyms and abbreviations
- Entity naming (what you call things in code vs UI)
- State/status values and their meanings

**Why it matters:** Prevents naming inconsistencies (e.g., "user" vs "account" vs "customer" used interchangeably).

---

## 12. Change Log
**Purpose:** Tracks evolution of the spec as a living document.

**Includes:**
- Version number
- Date of changes
- Summary of what changed
- Rationale for changes
- Impact on implementation

**Why it matters:** When you update the PRD, the agent can understand what's new vs. what was already implemented.
